## Probability and Naive Bayes
_Wednesday 4/30/2014_
_We'll be reviewing some basics of probability, developing ways to work with text data, and using a classification algorithm to classify text._

#### Objectives
* Articulate Naive Bayes' advantages, flaws, applications and theoretical foundation
* Explain how Naive Bayes is applied to classify text or Spam
* Be familiar with using the N.B. classifiers in NLTK and SKLearn
* Create a basic Naive Bayes classifier

#### Materials
* [NB_Gender_Names_NLTK:]() Notebook covering basics of Naive Bayes with single features
* [NB_Biebama_NLTK:]() Demo: Classifying text as Obama or Bieber
* [NB_Movies_SKLearn:]() Illustration of SK Learn NB functions
* [NB_Movies_NTLK:]() Illustration of NB on text with NLTK

#### Assignments
* Add a feature to the NLTK gender classifier to try and improve performance
* Create a classifier to tell the difference between two authors
* Brainstorm classification topics for projects (due May 14)
