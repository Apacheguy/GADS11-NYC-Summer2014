# Visualization Lesson Overview [DRAFT]

## Lectures to Use/Follow

* Use Arun's Lesson04 Slides?

* Provide some principles of dataviz

* What's the right use case for using: (without even getting into the code)
  * Scatterplot
  * Histogram
  * Pie Chart(no -- circle chart)
  * Very first glance. 

* Give examples for critique (what's good, what's bad, how would you do it)

* End the lecture with some examples with the code aligned
  * ggplot vs. matplotb
  
* Lab -- Getting familiar with it and communicating a point


* [CS109 on DataViz](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cs109/content/blob/master/labs/lab3/lab3full.ipynb) is great: "Exploratory Data Analysis for Classification using Pandas and Matplotlib"
   * Just up to the "Part 3 Pandas Section" should be sufficient.
   * Suggest adapting it
   * Includes Pandas, EDA, Munging, and lots of pretty plots like:
