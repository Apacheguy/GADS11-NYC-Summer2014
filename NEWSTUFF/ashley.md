###Start of Course

Day 1 ideas:

* collecting granular level data about where they are in math and programming
* design a quiz to give them at the beginning of day 1 to test their "on the spot" programming and thinking through problems. Something simple from project Euler should work. Keep in mind their code is the more important part and not the answer.
* really in depth review of git. Just assume no one understands it and guide them through a submission of a text file about themselves and the python code they wrote up to get the "quiz" done. Literally walk them through this.
	* standardize the git workflow to be just git bash. Having multiple flows is a painful process since you'll have multiple approaches to handling it
	* Our TA wrote up some docs about how to do the git workflow as well.
	

### Breadth of Course

##### Unit 1

* Unit 1 on EDA/Exploratory Data Analysis. spending a lot of time here on how to work through exploring data and finding trends (and explaining what a trend actually is)
* If it helps (particularly for Patrick as he works as a consultant), be very meta during your day-to-day work to get a better sense of how to drive the EDA unit. How do you work on a project, what notes do you take, etc etc. This will design how you approach these labs very well (I think)
* Keeping lessons simple seem to be the most effective. We tried to cover a lesson on APIs and I wrote up a python wrapper for the NYTimes Article API and they had a really hard time understanding what was going on. Trying to cover all of pandas is one day was too much. We know historically this is spot on (like every time we've tried to do SVMs + Kernels in one day, forget anyone actually following along)


#####Other units

* Working on relevant data. pre-cleaned data sets are nice but they don't teach anything in understanding machine learning pitfalls. 
* Less focus on algorithms, more on implementation. It took a long time for out class to identify the modularity of sklearn and how many of the implementations are the same. 
* Less focus on theory, more on application. Have a lot of different approaches explained to different data problems, in order to explain 
* Wish we did more of earlier: time series analysis, comparing classifiers, matplotlib in super super super super detail.
* Wish we did less of earlier: ensembling, anything else that won't have immediate impact on their final project work.

###Anything else from Ashley's Email

- Sharing course materials/repo (what combination works best?)
	- this is fine if you commit to it.
	- It really took a while for us to get the git formula down. 
	- In general I still think students are uncomfortable with it.
		- If you're going to go git for student submissions, really make sure you own it.
		- Otherwise, allow all the work to be on git (or just give them an nbviewer link), and student submissions other ways (dropbox? will GA pay for that?)

- Co-instructor model insights and workflow (how do you and Ed work together?)
	- I think this works really well!
	- Requires a lot of time to work together, primarily in the earlier segments of the class
	- students are very aware when instructors aren't in sync with eachother, which stinks
	- can overcome that by making sure that is not the case :)
	
- What would you have done differently in weeks 1-3?
	- think this is listed above, but to reiterate in case:
	- first week has to be incredibly slow. if you think it's slow, go slower. Students will really appreciate it
	- Spent more time getting to know the students better. They are cool people.
	- Really developing a great curriculum for python basics with pandas and matplotlib. 
	- make it super clear that we don't expect anyone to be experts and that everyone is in a learning process, and we all make mistakes!
	
- Tailoring the course to student needs/constant iterating
	- dave and I did this a lot, and Patrick should already have experience with what this felt like at a much smaller scale. Stick to their interests and you will have a great class. be prepared to have to step back every once and awhile.
	
- Student feedback 
	- This is where the core learning happens. student's love hearing from the TA but they care more about what you have to say about their work. find assignments where iteration is key. it shows them their work is never "final" and can always be improved
