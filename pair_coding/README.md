# Pair Learning

In this course, we've reserved time during each class to work on guided pair learning following the "pair programming" paradigm:

// Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

One student will begin as _driver_ and the other as _navigator_, and they will switch off half-way throught the period.

## Benefits of Pair Learning
The benefits to working through data science topics using pair learning include:
* Greater focus
* Enhanced understanding of the material due to need to communicate 
* Getting to know your fellow scientists
* Its way funner

## Team Rotation
Students will have a different randomly selected (without replacement) partner to code with each week.
